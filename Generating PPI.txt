Generating PPI Network Files -

Scripts are found in ppi.py
The purpose of these scripts is to generate the "background" files that contain
protein-protein interactions on each line. The scripts work for human as well
as mouse data.

Usage: 

1) Download a file from PSICQUIC 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/psicquic/view/main.xhtml)

The MINT, innateDB, DIP, IntAct and Biogrid are fully supported,
similarly structured other ones may work as well.

2) Next, it's important to check what type of gene symbols are stored in the
PSCIQUIC file - the two which are currently supported are Uniprot IDs and 
Entrez Gene IDs. This will decide which of the two conversion functions/files
you will use.

3) It's also important to check in what field the gene symbols reside. This
will decide which getInteractors function you will use. 

Pre-canned versions of the function are made for each of the MINT, DIP, IntAct,
and Biogrid databases and are found at the bottom of the file. 
These functions are as follows:

runMINT(), runInnateDB(), runDIP(), runIntAct(), runBioGrid()
Each of them requires a file named after the dataset (e.g. MINT.txt) to be
present in the same directory as the script to run properly.

Otherwise, you may want to run the script on your own to customize the various
input files. That works as follows:

outputList, errorList = processPSICQUIC(convertLoadFn,
										filename,
										mouse_file,
										human_file,
										homologene_file,
										getInteractors,
										getSpecies,
										convertID,
										additionalInfoFn = None)

convertLoadFn - function to load in the conversion files, depends on symbol type
filename - the PSICQUIC file you wish to parse
mouse_file - gene symbol conversions for mice
human_file - gene symbol conversions for humans
homologene_file - NCBI homologene conversion file from mouse genes to human ones
getInteractors - function to get interactor names from a line in the PPI file
getSpecies - function to get species names from a line in the PPI file
convertID - function to convert Gene IDs, depends on symbol type
additionalInfoFn - only currently used for IntAct, usually None

Options - 

convertLoadFn: 
	loadEntrez (used for Entrez Gene IDs)
	loadUniprot (used for Uniprot Gene IDs)

getInteractors:
	mintInteractors (works for MINT dataset and many others - most general one)
	innateDBInteractors (works for innateDB dataset)
	barInteractors (works for BAR dataset)
	bioGridInteractors (works for BioGrid dataset)
	intActInteractors (works for IntAct dataset) 

getSpecies:
	getSpecies (works for everything)

convertID:
	uniprotConvert (works for Uniprot Gene IDs)
	entrezGeneConvert (works for Entrez Gene IDs)

additionalInfoFn:
	interactionType 


4) If you want to remove high throughput studies, you can use the function 
removeHighThroughput(ppi_list, thresh). Using your outputList as an argument
as well as the threshold for the minimum number of interactions in a study to
be considered high throughput, you can eliminate all such studies. 
This is present in all the pre-canned functions with a threshold of 10, 
but is available as an option to the user if running the scripts on your own.

5) writePPI(ppi_list, output_filename) will just write your outputList to a 
text file of your desired name.
